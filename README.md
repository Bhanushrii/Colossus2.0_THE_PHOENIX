Identify the issue : 
Digital assessments often overlook accessibility needs, leaving millions of learners at a disadvantage.
 Most platforms fail to support screen readers, alternative input methods, multilingual formats, and right-to-left scripts,
 despite the existence of global accessibility standards like WCAG 2.1 and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
 Educators lack tools to design and preview assessments from the perspective of diverse learners, making it difficult to
 ensure fairness and inclusivity for all.
 The result is a digital divide where students with disabilities struggle to demonstrate their true potential — not because
 of a lack of ability, but because the platform itself isn’t built for them.
 Explain its significance: 
This problem matters because education should empower everyone — not just the majority.
 When digital assessments lack accessibility, they exclude millions of learners with disabilities from fair and equal
 opportunities.
 With over 1 billion people worldwide living with disabilities, inaccessibility in assessments widens the education gap and
 reinforces inequality.
 Accessibility is more than compliance — it's about dignity, fairness, and inclusion.
